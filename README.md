# Practice-Multithreading


A condition_variable is a synchronization primitive in the C++ Standard Library used for communication between threads in concurrent programming. It is typically used in combination with a mutex to provide a mechanism for one thread to wait for a condition to be met by another thread.

The basic usage pattern for a condition_variable is as follows:

A thread locks a mutex to access a shared resource.
The thread checks the state of the shared resource and determines whether it meets the desired condition.
If the condition is not met, the thread calls wait on the condition_variable, passing the locked mutex as a parameter.
The wait call atomically releases the lock on the mutex and blocks the thread until another thread calls notify_one or notify_all on the same condition_variable.
A different thread locks the same mutex, modifies the shared resource so that the desired condition is met, and then calls notify_one or notify_all on the condition_variable.
The first thread is unblocked, reacquires the lock on the mutex, and continues execution.
The condition_variable is a powerful tool for coordinating the behavior of multiple threads, and is used in many synchronization algorithms.
